### HOW TO PLAY

#### BASICS

The goal of Minesweeper is the mark all the mines on the grid while clearing all the squares without mines. Each cleared square will either be blank or will contain a number. That number represents how many mines are surrounding that square (if the square is blank then there are no mines that surround the square). Armed with the numbers, players use logic and reasoning to figure out where the remaining mines are.


In the image below, the player clicked on the board which opened up a large area in the left-center.

Based on the numbers, the player was able to place the following flags.
* Since the '1' at 4th column and 4th row only had one uncleared space surrounding it, the player deduced that's where the mine was and flagged it.
* This was also the case for the '1' at the 2nd column and 5th row, and for the '2' at the 5th column and 6th row.

And then based on those flags, they continued to clear the board.

#### SURVIVOR MODE

In SURVIVOR mode, the goal isn't just to clear the board of mines, but to do it in as little time as possible. The game starts with only 5 mines on the board and 1 minute already on the clock. Unlike in traditional Minesweeper, this clock ticks down. If it hits zero, game over.

Every time you clear the board, you advance to the next level. Every level advance comes with more points, but also 5 more mines. Any leftover time left on the clock from the previous level gets carried over as well, and you also get an additional time bonus for the new level. The farther you advance, the higher the score!
